## The Department of Data and Coding Affairs (DoDCA)

DoDCA is a semi-serious impersonation of an executive agency or government department whose responsibility is to make open source tools for data, analysis and code
in government and the public sector.

DoDCA **is not affiliated with any government anywhere**. However, we would like to pay tribute to the many public servants in civil services around the world who
work tirelessly, often in difficult circumstances, to improve the lot of their fellow citizens.

DoDCA is what you get if a group of volunteer developers work together without the bureaucratic and political burdens imposed by large organisations, such as
civil services. Our projects are simple, open and collaborative. We expect participants to work in an affirmative
[spirit of being together](https://github.com/ntoll/being_together/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) based on mutual respect, tolerance and compassion.

Should you wish to be involved, please look around our repositories for issues labelled as suitable for new joiners. Thank you..!
